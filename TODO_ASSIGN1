P423 COMPILER: Assignment1 Framework:
-------------------------------------

TODO

 * First, read the assignment description.
   
 * In this assignment you will populate the ./compiler/ directory with
   one or more source files.

 * At least one of those source files must be ./compiler/compile.ss.
   This is the main entry point into your compiler and must satisfy
   certain constraints for us to be able to execute your compiler.

    - It must define a library named (compiler compile)
    - That library must export p423-compile and p423-compile-passes

    - You may be unfamiliar with the R6RS system for defining scheme
      *libraries* (separate compilation units).  For this first
      assignment we provide example code for compile.ss, which follows
      below.  


-------------------------------------

(library (compiler compile)
  (export p423-compile p423-compile-passes)
  (import 
    ;; Load Chez Scheme primitives:
    (chezscheme)
    ;; Load provided compiler framework:
    (framework driver)
    (framework wrappers)
    (framework match)
    (framework helpers)
    ;; Load your passes from the file you wrote them in. 
    ;; If that file is called passes.ss, it would be
    (compiler passes))

;; Given a thunk that generates assembly code, this will compile the 
;; resulting assembly code and output it to a file named t.s
(define (assemble thunk)
  (with-output-to-file "t.s"
    thunk 
    'replace)
  (unless (zero? (system "cc -m64 -o t t.s framework/runtime.c"))
    (error 'assemble "assembly failed"))
  "./t")

;; Defines the compiler
(define-compiler (p423-compile p423-compile-passes pass->wrapper)
  (verify-scheme)
  (generate-x86-64 assemble))

;; See the drivers.ss file for other options when defining a compiler

) ;; End library
